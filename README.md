# VitaBot
This is a Discord and Twitter tipbot for [Vitamin Coin ðŸ’Š](https://vitamincoin.org).
<br>
The discord version is currently in their [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/sUvQufEqna)!
<br>
The twitter version is currently under ongoing tests, can be used at [@vitctipbot](https://twitter.com/vitctipbot)

## What is Vitamin Coin?
[Vitamin Coin (VITC)](https://vitamincoin.org) is a cryptocurrency built on top of the [VITE](https://www.vite.org/) network (spoiler alert: it's the only healthy crypto).

## What can it do?
This bot can store, tip, and send (incl. rains, giveaways and airdrops) [VITC](https://vitamincoin.org) and all other tokens on the [VITE](https://www.vite.org/) network!
<br>
Every transaction is done on-chain, seeds are stored in a database.

*PS: This bot uses special vitamins to make transations go faster :) (let's call that "plus vite")*

## How to use this bot?

You can tip users by doing `.v <amount> <@mention/id>` (e.g `.v 1337 @Not Thomiz#001`)

A dedicated [VITE](https://www.vite.org/) wallet will be created automatically for you upon receiving a tip or running the `.deposit` command if you don't already have one.

Otherwise, you can still use the `.help` command to get a list of available commands.

## Add this bot to your server
If you want to add this bot in your own server, simply click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=891314894413127740&permissions=388160&scope=bot).
<br>
You won't have access to every functionality of the bot like giveaways and rains, but tipping will work no matter the server.

If you have special requests for your server, or want me to enable a feature, please [DM me on Discord](https://discord.com/users/696481194443014174).

## Should I run my own instance of the bot?
If you want to run a parallel [VITC](https://vitamincoin.org) tipbot, probably not.
<br>
The issues you'll inevitably run into are:
- Users of the official [VITC](https://vitamincoin.org) tipbot (most of the [VITC](https://vitamincoin.org) users that have either Discord or Twitter) would have to manage depositing on 2 different wallets, which is rather annoying.
- Having 2 bots to do the exact same thing on a same server or social network is impractical and essentially useless.

If you want to fork the bot to add a feature, you should rather go to the "Contributing" section instead to get that feature included in the main bot.

If you want to add basically anything else to the bot, you should also go to the "Contributing" section and either ask for it or PR it, as having a bajillion forks of the same project will inevitably lead to confusion.

## Contributing
If you find a bug, or have an idea for a new feature, you can file an issue/PR.
