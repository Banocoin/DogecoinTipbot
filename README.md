#Dogecoin Tipbot

## What can it do?
This bot can store, tip, and send (incl. rains, giveaways and airdrops) [VITC](https://vitamincoin.org) and all other tokens on the [VITE](https://www.vite.org/) network!
<br>
Every transaction is done on-chain, seeds are stored in a database.

## How to use this bot?

You can tip users by doing `.d <amount> <@mention/id>` (e.g `.v 1337 @bananoman#1337)

A dedicated [VITE](https://www.vite.org/) wallet will be created automatically for you upon receiving a tip or running the `.deposit` command if you don't already have one in which blockchain DOGE-000 is currently on.

Otherwise, you can still use the `.help` command to get a list of available commands.

## Add this bot to your server

## Can I run my own instance of the bot?
Short answer: Maybe?

Dogecoin Tipbot does not have any License.
